# Policies for Safe Tool Use

- Respect `controls/allowlist.yaml` for any shell or file operations.
- Propose changes via `controls/change_requests.md` (do not execute unlisted commands).
- Keep edits atomic and traceable; update `docs/deliverables.md` statuses.
- Log any executions in `controls/execution_log.md`.
